			 The BMW Company was first established as an business entity, following a restructuring of the Rapp Motorenwerke aircraft manufacturing firm in 1917.
			 In 1918, aftermath of the World War I, was forced to stop aircraft-engine production by the terms of the Versailles Armistice Treaty as a result of German loss during the World War.
			 Facing the disability of producing aircraft-engine, the company shifted the production of motorcycle in 1923, followed up by automobile production later in the 1928-29.
			 The very first car the BMW company produced was named Dixi, based on the Austin 7 and licensed from the Austin Motor Company in Birmingham, England.
